# OAuth Error 400 Fix - "Missing required parameter: redirect_uri"

## Problem
You're getting "Error 400: invalid_request - Missing required parameter: redirect_uri" when trying to authenticate with Gmail.

## Root Cause
The OAuth flow wasn't properly configured with a redirect URI parameter.

## âœ… Solution Applied

I've fixed the code to properly handle the redirect URI. The issue was:

1. **Missing redirect_uri parameter** in the OAuth flow
2. **Incorrect flow configuration** for out-of-band authentication

## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed

### Updated Gmail Service
- Added explicit `flow.redirect_uri = 'urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob'`
- Proper `access_type='offline'` and `prompt='consent'` parameters
- Simplified client configuration

### Google Cloud Console Requirements

**Important:** Make sure your OAuth client in Google Cloud Console is configured as:

1. **Application type:** Desktop application
2. **Authorized redirect URIs:** Should include `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob`

If you created it as "Web application", you need to either:
- Create a new "Desktop application" OAuth client, OR
- Add `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob` to authorized redirect URIs

## ðŸ§ª Test the Fix

### Option 1: Quick Test
```bash
# Test OAuth configuration
python test_oauth.py
```

### Option 2: Full Authentication
```bash
# Clean up old tokens
rm -f token.json

# Test authentication
python auth_gmail.py
```

## ðŸ“‹ Expected Flow Now

1. **Script generates proper OAuth URL** with redirect_uri parameter
2. **You open URL in browser** - should work without 400 error
3. **Complete Google authorization**
4. **Copy authorization code** from the success page
5. **Paste code in terminal** - token gets saved

## ðŸš¨ If Still Getting Errors

### Check Your OAuth Client Type
```bash
# Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
# Find your OAuth client
# Check: Application type should be "Desktop application"
```

### Create New OAuth Client (if needed)
1. Go to Google Cloud Console â†’ APIs & Services â†’ Credentials
2. Click "Create Credentials" â†’ "OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
3. Choose "Desktop application"
4. Name it "Gmail Verification Bot"
5. Copy the new Client ID and Secret to your .env file

## ðŸŽ¯ The Fix Explained

**Before:** OAuth flow was missing the redirect_uri parameter
**After:** Explicitly set `flow.redirect_uri = 'urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob'`

This tells Google to use "out-of-band" authentication, which shows the authorization code on a webpage for manual copying - perfect for server environments!
